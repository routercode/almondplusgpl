	  The anx9805 controller supports both DP and DVI mode. In the
          DP mode, the lanes of anx9805 are directly mapping onto the
          lanes of hdmi connector; however, in the DVI/HDMI mode, the
          lane0/2 of anx9805 are mapping onto the lane2/0 of
          hdmi connector. To support the feature, add this function.
