        default n
        ---help---
          This provides support for the original Flash Translation Layer which
          is part of the PCMCIA specification. It uses a kind of pseudo-
          file system on a flash device to emulate a block device with
          512-byte sectors, on top of which you put a 'normal' file system.

          You may find that the algorithms used in this code are patented
          unless you live in the Free World where software patents aren't
          legal - in the USA you are only permitted to use this on PCMCIA
          hardware, although under the terms of the GPL you're obviously
          permitted to copy, modify and distribute the code as you wish. Just
          not use it.

          This allows you to configure the total size of the MTD device
          emulated by the MTDRAM driver.  If the MTDRAM driver is built
          as a module, it is also possible to specify this as a parameter when
          loading the module.

        int "MTDRAM erase block size in KiB"

          This allows you to configure the size of the erase blocks in the
          device emulated by the MTDRAM driver.  If the MTDRAM driver is built
          as a module, it is also possible to specify this as a parameter when

        help
          If you have system RAM accessible by the CPU but not used by Linux
          in normal operation, you can give the physical address at which the
          available RAM starts, and the MTDRAM driver will use it instead of
          allocating space from Linux's available memory. Otherwise, leave
          this set to zero. Most people will want to leave this as zero.
