	  Decide how many DRAM bank be allocated for HW QM. This option works
	  only if CS752X_HW_INTERNAL_BUFFERS be disabled. i.e. This is exclusive
	  with CS752X_HW_INTERNAL_BUFFERS. If CS752X_HW_INTERNAL_BUFFERS is enabled,
	  then all DRAM bank were allocated for Linux kernel. If CS752X_HW_INTERNAL_BUFFERS
	  is disabled, number of DRAM bank will be reserved for QM module.
