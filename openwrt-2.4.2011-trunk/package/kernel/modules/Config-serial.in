config KERNEL_MTD_MTDRAM
	tristate "Test driver using RAM"
	default y
	help
	  This enables a test MTD device driver which uses vmalloc() to
	  provide storage.  You probably want to say 'N' unless you're
	  testing stuff.

config KERNEL_MTDRAM_TOTAL_SIZE
	int "MTDRAM device size in KiB"
	default "4096"
	help
	  This allows you to configure the total size of the MTD device
	  emulated by the MTDRAM driver.  If the MTDRAM driver is built
	  as a module, it is also possible to specify this as a parameter when
	  loading the module.

config KERNEL_MTDRAM_ERASE_SIZE
	int "MTDRAM erase block size in KiB"
	default "128"
	help
	  This allows you to configure the size of the erase blocks in the
	  device emulated by the MTDRAM driver.  If the MTDRAM driver is built
	  as a module, it is also possible to specify this as a parameter when
	  loading the module.

config KERNEL_MTDRAM_ABS_POS
        hex "SRAM Hexadecimal Absolute position or 0"
        default "0"
        help
          If you have system RAM accessible by the CPU but not used by Linux
          in normal operation, you can give the physical address at which the
          available RAM starts, and the MTDRAM driver will use it instead of
          allocating space from Linux's available memory. Otherwise, leave
          this set to zero. Most people will want to leave this as zero.
