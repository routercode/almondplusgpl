See http://sv-wiki-01/wiki/index.php/Merging_Android_Kernel_with_G2

These scripts are useful:

apply.sh
  Apply all of the patches in a remote directory to "here":
  apply.sh /a/b/d/patches

merge.pl
  Merge kernel config options into a larger .config file for the
  kernel.  Was used to merge in the "required" android config into
  the default g2 .config.  See Documentation/android.txt for required
  and optional kernel config.

cvscmds.pl
  Compare two trees and create a list of cvs add and remove commands 
  that would be need to take one tree (the parent) and turn it into the 
  other tree.  Generates a file used by patch.pl below.
  cvscmds.pl new-tree old-tree > patch-in

patch.pl
  Used to read in command file from cvscmds.pl above and execute the
  cvs commands.  Run it at the top of the tree in CVS you want to 
  modify.

break.pl
  Takes one big patch file and breaks it into individual patch files
  grouped by using the first directory name after the base dir to
  create filenames.  Used to break the big android.patch into smaller
  patches, so categories can be left off.
