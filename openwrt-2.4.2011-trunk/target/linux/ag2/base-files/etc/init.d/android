# OpenWRT should be up and stable by now.
# Now we can launch the Android framework.
# /init.android is the android "/init" executable,
# which reads /init.rc to launch the framework.
#
# We have found that udev and android's processes
# collide.  Android apparently does its own udev -like
# thing, probably with ueventd, which is a symlink
# to /init.android.  This "udev" collision needs to
# be explored.  But currently, if you kill off udev
# before running /init.android, things *seem* to be
# working reasonably well.

# fix_log
# Logging is not quite right.  Looks like the G2 kernel is
# creating /dev/log as a file.  But Android wants /dev/log/main
# and a few other files there.  Seems it creates /dev/log_main
# instead (because /dev/log is already there?).  The "fix" for
# now is the following function.  It makes /system/bin/logcat
# work, which is very useful for debug.
