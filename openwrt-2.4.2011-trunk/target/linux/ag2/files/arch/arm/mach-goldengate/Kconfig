          Support for the Golden-Gate ASIC. The Accelerator Coherency Port (ACP) is a feature
          of Cortex-A9, which provides an AXI slave port that can be connected to a DMA engine,
          providing the DMA access to the SCU of Cortex-A9. Addresses on the ACP port are physical
          addresses which can be snooped by the SCU to provide full I/O coherency.
