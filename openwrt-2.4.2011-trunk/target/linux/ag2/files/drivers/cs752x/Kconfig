          If you have enabled the serial port on the Cortina baseboard
          you can make it the console by answering Y to this option.

          Even if you say Y here, the currently visible virtual console
          (/dev/tty0) will still be used as the system console by default, but
          you can alter that using a kernel command line option such as
          "console=ttyS0". (Try "man bootparam" or see the documentation of
          your boot loader (lilo or loadlin) about how to pass options to the
          kernel at boot time.)
